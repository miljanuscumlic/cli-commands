Useful command-line interface commands for git and other software tools and programs. <br /><br />
This repository's intention is to document both commonly used commands and the ones that may be lesser known but if used could improve programmer's productivity. Our aim is not to cover all the options and switches at all costs, but to provide a good understanding of a commands in a concise way on a single page per a software tool. <br />
Use your command-line tools like a skillful gymnast. :wink:

## Usage

Point your favorite web browser to this simple and fine [repository](https://github.com/miljanuscumlic/cli-commands) :blush: and browse through its `/commands` directory while you are building the software at your work or for fun, hopefully both at the same time. :wink:

Every file containing cli commands has a header:

   | Command | Description | Note | Version | Docs |
   |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |

In the best case scenario **Version** column should contain the software version that introduced the particular command. In spite of that it may and usually does contain the earliest known version in which the command is tested to work.<br />
**Docs** column contains the official documentation link describing the command in question.
