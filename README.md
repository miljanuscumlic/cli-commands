Useful command-line interface commands for git and other software tools and programs. <br /><br />
This repository's intention is to document both commonly used commands and the ones that may be lesser known but if used could improve programmer's productivity. Our aim is not to cover all the options and switches at all costs, but to provide a good understanding of a commands in a concise way on a single page per a software tool. <br />
Use your command-line tools like a skillful gymnast. :wink:

**Docs** column contains the official documentation link describing the command in question.
